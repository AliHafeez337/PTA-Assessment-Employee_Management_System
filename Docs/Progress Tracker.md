**Status:** 🟢 Completed  
**Progress:** 13/13 tasks (100%)

- [✅] Install Visual Studio for Mac (or VS Code + .NET SDK)
- [✅] Setup SQL Server 2019 container in Docker
- [✅] Connect to SQL Server using DBeaver
- [✅] Create new ASP.NET Core MVC project

3. **Project .csproj file named incorrectly:** Fixed - recreated project fresh ✅
4. **RootNamespace set to `_`:** Fixed - recreated project fresh ✅

### Approval Status: ✅ Module 0 COMPLETE

## MODULE 1: DATABASE & ENTITY FRAMEWORK

**Status:** 🟢 Completed  
**Progress:** 10/10 tasks (100%)  
**Started:** February 18, 2026  
**Completed:** February 18, 2026

### Tasks:
- [✅] Create Department.cs model class
- [✅] Create Employee.cs model class
- [✅] Create ApplicationDbContext.cs
- [✅] Configure Entity Framework in Program.cs
- [✅] Define model relationships (One Department → Many Employees)
- [✅] Install EF Core NuGet packages (v8.0.0)
- [✅] Install dotnet-ef CLI tool globally
- [✅] Create initial migration (InitialCreate)
- [✅] Update database (apply migration)
- [✅] Verify tables in DBeaver

### Files Created:
- `Models/Department.cs`
- `Models/Employee.cs`
- `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`
- `Program.cs` (updated)
- `Migrations/` folder (auto-generated by EF)

### NuGet Packages Installed:
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` v8.0.0
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` v8.0.0
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` v8.0.0

### Database Tables Created:
- `Departments` — DepartmentId, DepartmentName, DepartmentCode, ActiveInactive, CreatedDate
- `Employees` — EmployeeId, Name, Email, Salary, DepartmentId (FK), JoiningDate
- `__EFMigrationsHistory` — EF internal table to track applied migrations

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **EF (Entity Framework):** Library that lets you interact with the database using C# instead of raw SQL
- **DbContext:** The bridge between C# code and the database
- **Migrations:** EF reads your model classes and auto-generates SQL to create/update tables
- **virtual + ICollection:** Enables EF lazy loading for related data
- **get; set;:** C# property shorthand — compiler auto-generates a backing field
- **modelBuilder:** EF's configuration tool for unique indexes, relationships, constraints
- **base:** Calls the parent class constructor/method before your own code runs

### Approval Status: ✅ Module 1 COMPLETE

## MODULE 2: DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT

**Status:** 🟢 Completed  
**Progress:** 15/15 tasks (100%)  
**Started:** February 18, 2026  
**Completed:** February 18, 2026

### Tasks:

#### Day 1 Tasks (Basic CRUD):
- [✅] Create DepartmentController.cs
- [✅] Implement Index action (fetch all departments)
- [✅] Create Index.cshtml (list with table)
- [✅] Implement Create GET action
- [✅] Create Create.cshtml (add form)
- [✅] Implement Create POST action
- [✅] Test: Add departments

#### Day 2 Tasks (Edit/Delete/Fixes):
- [✅] Implement Edit GET action
- [✅] Create Edit.cshtml (pre-filled form)
- [✅] Implement Edit POST action
- [✅] Implement soft delete (ActiveInactive = false)
- [✅] Add jQuery client-side validation (via _ValidationScriptsPartial)
- [✅] Add server-side validation (ModelState + duplicate name check)
- [✅] Style pages with Bootstrap (badges, table-striped, alerts)
- [✅] Test all CRUD operations

### Files Created:
- `Controllers/DepartmentController.cs`
- `Views/Department/Index.cshtml`
- `Views/Department/Create.cshtml`
- `Views/Department/Edit.cshtml`
- `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (updated — added Departments nav link)
- `Docs/Concepts & Q&A Notes.md` (created — detailed reference for all concepts learned)

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **async/await:** Wait for DB response without freezing the app
- **IActionResult:** Return type that can be a View, Redirect, NotFound, etc.
- **[HttpPost]:** Marks an action to only run on form submissions
- **[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]:** Security token to prevent cross-site attacks
- **ModelState.IsValid:** Checks all data annotation validation rules pass
- **ModelState.AddModelError:** Manually add a validation error (e.g. duplicate name)
- **TempData:** Persists a value for exactly one redirect (used for success messages)
- **Soft Delete:** Setting ActiveInactive = false instead of removing the DB row
- **asp-for / asp-action / asp-route-id:** Razor tag helpers that generate correct HTML attributes
- **Hidden fields:** Carry data (like DepartmentId, CreatedDate) through form submissions invisibly

### Issues Encountered & Resolved:
1. **Departments not showing in list:** Create form was saving ActiveInactive = false because checkbox rendered unchecked. Fixed by passing `new Department()` from GET action so default value (true) is applied. ✅
2. **Design decision — show all departments:** Changed Index query to show both Active and Inactive departments, with color-coded badges (green = Active, red = Inactive) instead of filtering. ✅

### Approval Status: ✅ Module 2 COMPLETE - Ready for Module 3!

## DECISIONS LOG

### Decision 1: Technology Stack
- **Date:** February 17, 2026
- **Decision:** Use ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core
- **Reason:** Required by project specification

### Decision 2: Development Approach
- **Date:** February 17, 2026
- **Decision:** Incremental module-by-module development
- **Reason:** Easier for learning, allows testing at each stage

### Decision 3: EF Core Version
- **Date:** February 18, 2026
- **Decision:** Use EF Core v8.0.0 with .NET 10
- **Reason:** Stable version compatible with SQL Server 2019 Docker setup

### Decision 4: Show All Departments in List
- **Date:** February 18, 2026
- **Decision:** Show both Active and Inactive departments in the list with color-coded badges
- **Reason:** Better visibility and management; user requested this behavior
- **Impact:** Removed the ActiveInactive filter from the Index query

### Decision 5: Hard Delete Instead of Soft Delete
- **Date:** February 18, 2026
- **Decision:** Changed Department delete to permanently remove the record from the DB
- **Reason:** User preference — soft delete was causing confusion (deleted records still visible)
- **Impact:** `_context.Departments.Remove(department)` replaces the ActiveInactive = false approach

## ISSUES & RESOLUTIONS LOG

|---|--------|-------|------------|------|

| 3 | Module 0 | .csproj named incorrectly | Recreated project with correct name | Feb 17 |
| 4 | Module 0 | RootNamespace set to `_` | Recreated project fresh | Feb 17 |
| 5 | Module 2 | Departments not showing in list | Checkbox was unchecked by default; fixed by passing `new Department()` from GET Create action | Feb 18 |

## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS LOG

| # | Question | Answer | Module |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | What is `virtual` on a navigation property? | Enables EF lazy loading — related data loaded only when accessed | Module 1 |
| 2 | What does `get; set;` mean? | C# shorthand property — compiler auto-generates a backing field | Module 1 |
| 3 | What is `modelBuilder`? | EF's configuration tool for indexes, relationships, constraints | Module 1 |
| 4 | What is `base`? | Calls the parent class constructor/method before your own code runs | Module 1 |
| 5 | What is EF? | Entity Framework — interact with DB using C# instead of raw SQL | Module 1 |
| 6 | `readonly` but assigned in constructor? | readonly allows assignment only once during construction — locked after that | Module 2 |
| 7 | How does `@section Scripts` handle validation? | data annotations → Tag Helpers render data-val-* HTML attributes → jQuery validation reads them and shows errors automatically | Module 2 |
| 8 | What is ModelState? | Dictionary of form fields and validation errors; IsValid = true only when zero errors exist | Module 2 |
| 9 | What is `RedirectToAction(nameof(Index))`? | Sends HTTP 302 to browser to navigate to Index; nameof() returns method name as compile-safe string | Module 2 |
| 10 | How does asp-action + asp-route-id build the URL? | Razor Tag Helpers run server-side, read route config, generate correct href automatically | Module 2 |
| 11 | What is `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()`? | Renders a hidden input with a unique encrypted session token to prevent CSRF attacks | Module 2 |
| 12 | What is a CSRF attack? | Malicious site tricks browser into submitting a request with your session cookie; token prevents this | Module 2 |
| 13 | How is "Active" checkbox pre-checked? | Model has `= true` default; passing `new Department()` from GET action makes Razor render checkbox as checked | Module 2 |
| 14 | What does `@` mean in Razor? | Switches from HTML to C# mode; expression is evaluated and output written into HTML | Module 2 |
