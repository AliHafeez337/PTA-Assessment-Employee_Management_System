## MODULE 1: DATABASE & ENTITY FRAMEWORK

**Status:** 🟢 Completed
**Progress:** 10/10 tasks (100%)
**Started:** February 18, 2026
**Completed:** February 18, 2026

### Tasks:
- [✅] Create Department.cs model class
- [✅] Create Employee.cs model class
- [✅] Create ApplicationDbContext.cs
- [✅] Configure Entity Framework in Program.cs
- [✅] Define model relationships (One Department → Many Employees)
- [✅] Install EF Core NuGet packages (v8.0.0)
- [✅] Install dotnet-ef CLI tool globally
- [✅] Create initial migration (InitialCreate)
- [✅] Update database (apply migration)
- [✅] Verify tables in DBeaver

### Files Created:
- `Models/Department.cs`
- `Models/Employee.cs`
- `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`
- `Program.cs` (updated)
- `Migrations/` folder (auto-generated by EF)

### NuGet Packages Installed:
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` v8.0.0
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` v8.0.0
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` v8.0.0

### Database Tables Created:
- `Departments` — DepartmentId, DepartmentName, DepartmentCode, ActiveInactive, CreatedDate
- `Employees` — EmployeeId, Name, Email, Salary, DepartmentId (FK), JoiningDate (nullable)
- `__EFMigrationsHistory` — EF internal table to track applied migrations

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **EF (Entity Framework):** Library that lets you interact with the database using C# instead of raw SQL
- **DbContext:** The bridge between C# code and the database
- **Migrations:** EF reads your model classes and auto-generates SQL to create/update tables
- **virtual + ICollection:** Enables EF lazy loading for related data
- **get; set;:** C# property shorthand — compiler auto-generates a backing field
- **modelBuilder:** EF's configuration tool for unique indexes, relationships, constraints
- **base:** Calls the parent class constructor/method before your own code runs

### Approval Status: ✅ Module 1 COMPLETE

## MODULE 2: DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT

**Status:** 🟢 Completed
**Progress:** 15/15 tasks (100%)
**Started:** February 18, 2026
**Completed:** February 18, 2026

### Tasks:
- [✅] Create DepartmentController.cs
- [✅] Implement Index action (fetch all departments)
- [✅] Create Index.cshtml (list with table)
- [✅] Implement Create GET action
- [✅] Create Create.cshtml (add form)
- [✅] Implement Create POST action
- [✅] Implement Edit GET action
- [✅] Create Edit.cshtml (pre-filled form)
- [✅] Implement Edit POST action
- [✅] Implement hard delete with FK guard (blocks delete if employees exist)
- [✅] Add jQuery client-side validation
- [✅] Add server-side validation (ModelState + duplicate name check)
- [✅] Style pages with Bootstrap
- [✅] Show ErrorMessage TempData when delete is blocked
- [✅] Test all CRUD operations

### Files Created:
- `Controllers/DepartmentController.cs`
- `Views/Department/Index.cshtml`
- `Views/Department/Create.cshtml`
- `Views/Department/Edit.cshtml`
- `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (updated — added Departments nav link)

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **async/await:** Wait for DB response without freezing the app
- **IActionResult:** Return type that can be a View, Redirect, NotFound, Json, etc.
- **[HttpPost]:** Marks an action to only run on form submissions
- **[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]:** Security token to prevent cross-site attacks
- **ModelState.IsValid:** Checks all data annotation validation rules pass
- **ModelState.AddModelError:** Manually add a validation error (e.g. duplicate name)
- **TempData:** Persists a value for exactly one redirect (used for success/error messages)
- **Hard Delete:** Permanently removing a record (`_context.Remove()`)
- **FK Guard on Delete:** Check for dependent records before deleting; show friendly error if blocked
- **asp-for / asp-action / asp-route-id:** Razor tag helpers that generate correct HTML attributes

### Issues Encountered & Resolved:
1. **Departments not showing in list:** Checkbox was rendering unchecked by default. Fixed by passing `new Department()` from GET Create action so the default `true` value is applied. ✅
2. **Soft delete kept records visible:** Changed to hard delete (`Remove()`) per user preference. ✅
3. **Department delete crashed with FK error:** Added employee count check before delete; shows `TempData["ErrorMessage"]` if blocked. ✅

### Approval Status: ✅ Module 2 COMPLETE

## MODULE 3: EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT

**Status:** 🟢 Completed
**Progress:** 18/18 tasks (100%)
**Started:** February 18, 2026
**Completed:** February 18, 2026

### Tasks:

#### Day 1 Tasks (List & Add):
- [✅] Create EmployeeController.cs
- [✅] Implement Index action (with eager-loaded Department via `.Include()`)
- [✅] Create Index.cshtml (employee table)
- [✅] Create _CreateEmployee.cshtml (partial view / popup form)
- [✅] Add "Add Employee" button that opens modal
- [✅] Populate department dropdown (active departments only)
- [✅] Implement Create POST action with duplicate email check
- [✅] Add jQuery modal open/close handling
- [✅] Add AJAX form submission (no page reload)
- [✅] Refresh list after add

#### Day 2 Tasks (Edit/Delete/AJAX):
- [✅] Create _EditEmployee.cshtml (partial view / popup form)
- [✅] Implement Edit GET and POST actions
- [✅] Implement Delete action (AJAX, with antiforgery token)
- [✅] Add `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` to Index page (required for delete AJAX)
- [✅] Create GetDepartmentEmployeeCount AJAX endpoint
- [✅] Display employee count when department is selected in form
- [✅] Add client-side validation via `_ValidationScriptsPartial`
- [✅] Test all operations

### Files Created:
- `Controllers/EmployeeController.cs`
- `Views/Employee/Index.cshtml`
- `Views/Employee/_CreateEmployee.cshtml`
- `Views/Employee/_EditEmployee.cshtml`
- `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (updated — added Employees nav link)

### Migrations Added:
- `NullableJoiningDate` — changed `JoiningDate` from `DateTime` to `DateTime?`

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **Partial View:** A fragment of HTML (no layout) returned by a controller and injected into the page via AJAX
- **e.preventDefault():** Must be first in a submit handler — stops page reload even if later JS throws
- **[Range] on int:** Use instead of [Required] for int fields — [Required] always passes on value types
- **DateTime? (nullable):** Defaults to null instead of 0001-01-01, fixing the date picker bug
- **$.validator.unobtrusive.parse():** Re-wires jQuery validation for forms injected dynamically via AJAX
- **.Include():** EF eager loading — loads related entities (e.g. Department) in the same query
- **return Json(...):** Returns JSON to AJAX callers instead of HTML; used for success/failure responses
- **Html.PartialAsync vs RenderPartialAsync:** Use `PartialAsync` inside `@section` blocks; `RenderPartialAsync` returns void and cannot be used there
- **@Html.AntiForgeryToken() on list pages:** Required when AJAX calls POST endpoints from a page with no form

### Issues Encountered & Resolved:
1. **Page refreshing instead of AJAX submit:** `onsubmit` inline handler threw JS error before `return false`. Fixed by switching to jQuery `.on('submit')` with `e.preventDefault()` as the very first line. ✅
2. **`$.validator is undefined`:** `_ValidationScriptsPartial` not included on Index page. Fixed by adding `@await Html.PartialAsync("_ValidationScriptsPartial")` to the Scripts section. ✅
3. **Build error: `RenderPartialAsync` in section:** Returns void, can't be used with `@await` inside a section. Fixed by using `Html.PartialAsync` instead. ✅
4. **Date picker stuck on year 0001:** `DateTime` defaults to `DateTime.MinValue`. Fixed by making `JoiningDate` nullable (`DateTime?`) + added migration. ✅
5. **`[Required]` on `DepartmentId` always passes:** `int` is a value type, never null. Replaced with `[Range(1, int.MaxValue)]`. ✅
6. **Employee delete returns 400:** No antiforgery token on page; added `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` to Index.cshtml. ✅
7. **Browser HTML5 email tooltip:** `[EmailAddress]` causes Razor to render `type="email"`, triggering native browser validation. Expected behavior — not a bug. ✅

### Approval Status: ✅ Module 3 COMPLETE — Ready for Module 4!

## MODULE 4: SEARCH & FILTER

**Status:** 🟢 Completed
**Progress:** 9/9 tasks (100%)
**Started:** February 18, 2026
**Completed:** February 18, 2026

### Tasks:
- [✅] Add search textbox to Employee Index.cshtml
- [✅] Add department filter dropdown
- [✅] Implement search functionality (by name, server-side)
- [✅] Implement filter functionality (by department, server-side)
- [✅] Make search and filter work together (combined query)
- [✅] Add "Clear filters" button
- [✅] Show result count (changes wording when filters are active)
- [✅] Test with various search terms
- [✅] Test filter combinations

### Files Modified:
- `Controllers/EmployeeController.cs` — Index action updated to accept `searchName` and `departmentId` parameters
- `Views/Employee/Index.cshtml` — search/filter bar added above the table

### How It Works:
- Search form uses `method="get"` — filters appear as URL query parameters: `/Employee?searchName=Ali&departmentId=2`
- Controller builds the query dynamically using `.AsQueryable()` and chains `.Where()` only when a filter is provided
- Both filters combine — name search AND department filter can be active simultaneously
- `ViewBag.SearchName` and `ViewBag.SelectedDepartmentId` are passed back so inputs stay filled after submit
- "Clear" button is a plain `<a asp-action="Index">` link — navigates to `/Employee` with no parameters

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **`method="get"` on a form:** Submits filter values as URL query parameters instead of a POST body — bookmarkable, shareable, browser-back-button friendly
- **`AsQueryable()`:** Returns an IQueryable that lets you chain `.Where()` conditions dynamically before the query hits the database
- **Deferred execution:** The database query doesn't run until `.ToListAsync()` is called — all the `.Where()` chains just build up the SQL
- **Optional parameters (`string? searchName`, `int? departmentId`):** Controller accepts filters as nullable — if not provided they're null and no filter is applied

### Approval Status: ✅ Module 4 COMPLETE — Ready for Module 6 (Dashboard)!

## MODULE 6: DASHBOARD

**Status:** 🟢 Completed
**Progress:** 10/10 tasks (100%)
**Started:** February 18, 2026
**Completed:** February 18, 2026

### Tasks:
- [✅] Create DashboardViewModel.cs
- [✅] Update HomeController to inject ApplicationDbContext
- [✅] Calculate TotalEmployees (CountAsync)
- [✅] Calculate TotalActiveDepartments (CountAsync with filter)
- [✅] Calculate AverageSalary (AnyAsync check + AverageAsync)
- [✅] Replace Views/Home/Index.cshtml with dashboard layout
- [✅] Add three stat cards (Employees, Departments, Average Salary)
- [✅] Add quick links to Employees and Departments
- [✅] Verify navbar Home link points to HomeController
- [✅] Test statistics accuracy

### Files Created/Modified:
- `Models/DashboardViewModel.cs` — new ViewModel carrying the three stats
- `Controllers/HomeController.cs` — replaced with DB-connected version
- `Views/Home/Index.cshtml` — replaced with stat cards + quick links

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **ViewModel:** A class created specifically to carry data to a view — not a database model, just a container shaped for what the view needs
- **CountAsync():** Translates to `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ...` — can take a predicate to count filtered rows
- **AverageAsync():** Translates to `SELECT AVG(...) FROM ...` — throws if the table is empty, so always guard with `AnyAsync()` first
- **AnyAsync():** Translates to `SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS(...) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END` — fast existence check
- **DefaultIfEmpty(constant) limitation:** EF Core cannot translate `DefaultIfEmpty(0)` with a C# constant into SQL — use `AnyAsync()` guard instead

### Issues Encountered & Resolved:
1. **`DefaultIfEmpty(0)` could not be translated:** EF Core can't convert a C# constant fallback into SQL. Fixed by using `AnyAsync()` to check for rows first, then calling `AverageAsync()` only if rows exist — both are individually SQL-translatable. ✅

### Approval Status: ✅ Module 6 COMPLETE — Ready for Module 5 (Bulk Upload)!

## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS LOG

| # | Question | Answer | Module |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | What is `virtual` on a navigation property? | Enables EF lazy loading — related data loaded only when accessed | M1 |
| 2 | What does `get; set;` mean? | C# shorthand property — compiler auto-generates a backing field | M1 |
| 3 | What is `modelBuilder`? | EF's configuration tool for indexes, relationships, constraints | M1 |
| 4 | What is `base`? | Calls the parent class constructor/method before your own code runs | M1 |
| 5 | What is EF? | Entity Framework — interact with DB using C# instead of raw SQL | M1 |
| 6 | `readonly` but assigned in constructor? | readonly allows assignment only once during construction — locked after that | M2 |
| 7 | How does `@section Scripts` handle validation? | data annotations → Tag Helpers render data-val-* HTML attributes → jQuery validation reads them | M2 |
| 8 | What is ModelState? | Dictionary of form fields and validation errors; IsValid = true only when zero errors exist | M2 |
| 9 | What is `RedirectToAction(nameof(Index))`? | Sends HTTP 302 to browser to navigate to Index; nameof() is a compile-safe string | M2 |
| 10 | How does asp-action + asp-route-id build the URL? | Razor Tag Helpers run server-side, read route config, generate correct href automatically | M2 |
| 11 | What is `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()`? | Renders a hidden input with a unique encrypted session token to prevent CSRF attacks | M2 |
| 12 | What is a CSRF attack? | Malicious site tricks browser into submitting a request with your session cookie | M2 |
| 13 | How is "Active" checkbox pre-checked? | Model has `= true` default; passing `new Department()` from GET action makes Razor render it checked | M2 |
| 14 | What does `@` mean in Razor? | Switches from HTML to C# mode; expression is evaluated and output written into HTML | M2 |
| 15 | What is a Partial View? | A fragment of HTML (no layout) returned by a controller and injected into the page via AJAX | M3 |
| 16 | Why must `e.preventDefault()` be first? | Any JS error after the event starts causes the browser to fall back to default submit (page reload) | M3 |
| 17 | Why does `[Required]` not work on `int`? | `int` is a value type — never null — so `[Required]` always passes; use `[Range(1, int.MaxValue)]` instead | M3 |
| 18 | Why did the date picker get stuck on year 0001? | `DateTime` defaults to `DateTime.MinValue` (0001-01-01); fixed by using `DateTime?` (nullable) | M3 |
| 19 | Why add `_ValidationScriptsPartial` to a list page? | Forms are loaded dynamically via AJAX — jQuery validation libraries must be present on the host page | M3 |
| 20 | What does `$.validator.unobtrusive.parse()` do? | Re-wires jQuery validation for forms injected into the DOM after page load | M3 |
| 21 | Why did Employee delete return 400? | Antiforgery token missing — no form on the page; fixed by adding `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` | M3 |
| 22 | What is a FK constraint error? | Database blocks deleting a row that other rows still reference; check dependents first in C# | M3 |
| 23 | What is `.Include()` and why is it needed? | EF eager loading — loads related entities (e.g. Department) in the same query; without it, they're null | M3 |
| 24 | What is `return Json(...)` vs `return PartialView()`? | Json() sends data to AJAX callers; PartialView() sends HTML; AJAX handler checks `res.success` to tell them apart | M3 |
| 26 | What is `method="get"` on a search form? | Submits filters as URL query params — bookmarkable and back-button friendly; never use GET to change data | M4 |
| 28 | What is a ViewModel? | A class shaped for the view's needs — not a DB model, just a data container | M6 |
| 29 | Why guard `AverageAsync()` with `AnyAsync()`? | `AverageAsync()` throws on an empty table; `AnyAsync()` is a fast SQL-translatable existence check | M6 |
| 30 | Why can't EF translate `DefaultIfEmpty(0)`? | EF must convert LINQ to SQL; a C# constant fallback has no direct SQL equivalent so EF gives up | M6 |
